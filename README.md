# Text Preprocessing for Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This repository provides implementations for various text preprocessing techniques commonly used in NLP tasks.

## What is Text Preprocessing?
Text preprocessing is the crucial first step in preparing textual data for analysis by machines. It involves cleaning and transforming raw text into a format suitable for NLP algorithms. This improves the quality and efficiency of subsequent tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, and machine translation.

## Preprocessing Techniques Implemented:
This repository includes functions for the following text preprocessing methods:

* Lower Casing: Converts all characters in the text to lowercase for consistency.

* Removing HTML Tags: Removes any HTML tags present in the text data.

* Removing URLs: Identifies and removes URLs from the text.

* Removing Punctuations: Removes punctuation marks like commas, periods, exclamation points etc., depending on the use case.

* Spelling Corrections: Implements methods to correct potential spelling errors in the text (optional, may require additional libraries).

* Removing Stop Words: Eliminates commonly used words with little semantic meaning (e.g., "the", "a", "is").

* Handling Emojis: Detects and removes emojis or converts them to textual representations (depending on the use case).

* Tokenization: Splits the text into individual units like words or characters for further processing.

* Stemming & Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base form (stem) or their dictionary form (lemma) for improved consistency.

## Implementation details:
The code utilizes libraries like re (regular expressions) and nltk (Natural Language Toolkit) for various functionalities. Refer to the code comments and docstrings for specific implementation details.

## Getting Started:
* Clone this repository: git clone https://siddharth-karale/Text-Preprocessing-in-NLP.git
* Install required libraries (nltk etc.) using your preferred package manager (e.g., pip install nltk).
* Refer to the individual function docstrings within the code for usage examples.
